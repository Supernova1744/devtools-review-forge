VS Code,Capterra,"I use Visual Studio Code in two different ways: as a teacher and as a software developer. I like using it at school because it is very easy to install and integrate. It can also be used across Windows, Mac and Linux; which is a great plus. For my personal projects, I like its seamless GitHub and Maven integration. It is also very customizable. Visual Studio Code is visually appealing and once you get used to it, you can be very productive. Its integrated Terminal support makes it easy to use and test multiple projects at the same time.","Visual Studio Code is a freeware, fully functional, source source-code editor. With its great plugin support, you can use it do develop in many programming languages: Python, Java, C#, SQL, etc. It supports a lot of enhancements and it is very configurable. You can make use of many predefined actions though its Command Palette, a functionality where you popup a search-bar style menu with many shortcuts. It is constantly updated with new features and bug fixes, and it is heavily supported by Microsoft. Another great feature is the plugin manager. The community can integrate new languages and tools, which makes this tool extremely customizable. Sometimes, when loading a source code file, Visual Studio Code automatically suggests plugins that you might want to install, which is very nice.","Some workflows are not very intuitive, and need to be executed using the Command Palette. If you are migrating from another IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans, this will take some time to get used to. For example, to create a Java project, you need to open the Command Palette and type ""Java: Create Java Project"". Other IDEs have integrated wizards that are easier to use.",5.0
VS Code,Capterra,"My overall experience is very good, and I am satisfied with this software. I increased my productivity a lot since I use Visual Studio Code. I write the code much faster than ants, thanks to the plugin I incorporate. I have all the tools I need to program in the same software, so I don't need any other application to write the code and test some applications I develop. If I'm going to use a new language, download the right plugin and you're done. Sometimes there can be a bug in the software, for a while. It seems to consume much RAM for a few seconds and then decreases. It's not very annoying and hardly ever happens, but it's something that needs to be fixed. The plugin community grows every day, so I have fun trying the new ones out there. They are easy to install and uninstall, so I have no problem with that.",,,5.0

VS Code,Capterra,"I started coding in 2011, i used notepad first then notepad++ then tried atom and sublime editor but after that there was a gap, i remember even if i had static html files, or css files i used Microsoft Visual studio to edit them when there was no VSCode. When it came out i tried it and unlike others it became my only code editor, i even made it an IDE by adding many useful extensions to it. It actually makes you feel that you are a developer, it has all the features there, the command line makes it classic but its the fun. It has a vast community with thousands of free extensions out there out which you pick your useful ones. I will say its a complete code editor and if you are using Linux you don't need big IDE's as it will cover you up. The updates are sometimes frequent but i will say its negligible thing to look for. VSCode is a need for every developer and it fulfills it in best way!",,,5.0
VS Code,Capterra,"IntelliSense surely helped increasing productivity due to the code completion and the embedded terminal helped my workspace be a bit more organized with 1 less window to have to manage. I was already low on space due to all the software I required to make a multiplayer game. Since the plugins were so incredibly easy to install that saved some time as well. Sadly as I wrote in the Cons, after a while the application started experiencing stutters and all the productivity advantages diminished considerably to the point where I had to move away from Visual Studio Code. It is worth checking it out however, and I shall do that as well, since the updates are rolling so often, the issue might have been fixed.",,,4.0

The next thing, I loved about VS-Code is debugging. It has an in-built git, extensions market, plugins, and more. The most significant thing about the VS-Code is the simple text editor that supports split-screen inside the text editor itself. VS-Code has its own terminal for development. I mostly use its internal terminal for changing directories, compiling, and debugging the programs. So, it's simply great I don't need external terminals or command prompts for executing my programs.","Since VS-Code is not particularly an IDE, it mainly depends on other IDE like Android Studio and JetBrains IntelliJ.
