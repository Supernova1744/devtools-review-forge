VS Code,Capterra,"I use Visual Studio Code in two different ways: as a teacher and as a software developer. I like using it at school because it is very easy to install and integrate. It can also be used across Windows, Mac and Linux; which is a great plus. For my personal projects, I like its seamless GitHub and Maven integration. It is also very customizable. Visual Studio Code is visually appealing and once you get used to it, you can be very productive.

It is constantly updated with new features and bug fixes, and it is heavily supported by Microsoft. Another great feature is the plugin manager. The community can integrate new languages and tools, which makes this tool extremely customizable. Sometimes, when loading a source code file, Visual Studio Code automatically suggests plugins that you might want to install, which is very nice.","Some workflows are not very intuitive, and need to be executed using the Command Palette. If you are migrating from another IDE like Eclipse or NetBeans, this will take some time to get used to. For example, to create a Java project, you need to open the Command Palette and type ""Java: Create Java Project"". Other IDEs have integrated wizards that are easier to use.",5.0
VS Code,Capterra,"IntelliSense surely helped increasing productivity due to the code completion and the embedded terminal helped my workspace be a bit more organized with 1 less window to have to manage. I was already low on space due to all the software I required to make a multiplayer game. Since the plugins were so incredibly easy to install that saved some time as well. Sadly as I wrote in the Cons, after a while the application started experiencing stutters and all the productivity advantages diminished considerably to the point where I had to move away from Visual Studio Code. It is worth checking it out however, and I shall do that as well, since the updates are rolling so often, the issue might have been fixed.",,,4.0

VS Code,Capterra,"VS-Code is fast, customizable, and supports multiple programming languages. It is great in visual tweaks, as it is well suited for syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and the snippets for indented Sass. Moreover, using VS-code is like using most out of it. With a single mnemonics, you can expand the texts with just a mnemonics and 'tab' key. VS-code has everything I need for front-end development. VS-Code offers a lot of features including IntelliSense, which is great in showing code hints and auto-completing just on steroids.","VS- Code is great when it comes to typing syntax, it provides better suggestions, and a little more info and briefings for every code you type. The next thing, I loved about VS-Code is debugging. It has an in-built git, extensions market, plugins, and more. The most significant thing about the VS-Code is the simple text editor that supports split-screen inside the text editor itself. VS-Code has its own terminal for development. I mostly use its internal terminal for changing directories, compiling, and debugging the programs. So, it's simply great I don't need external terminals or command prompts for executing my programs.","Since VS-Code is not particularly an IDE, it mainly depends on other IDE like Android Studio and JetBrains IntelliJ.

It's the perfect alternative for the default python idle and some shortcuts and quick fixes for coding mistakes.
